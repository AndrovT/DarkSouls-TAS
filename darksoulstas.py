    Welcome to Dark Souls TAS Tools v{__version__}.
    
    Basic Keypresses:
        wait, start, select, up, down, left, right,
        a, b, x, y, l1, l2, l3, r1, r2, r3, 
        sprint, run, walk, run_back, walk_back,

        s_aim_up, s_aim_down, s_aim_left, s_aim_right
        
    Basic Functions:
        waitfor, walkfor, runfor, sprintfor
    
    Recording and Playback:
        Functions:
            record, playback, save, load
        Current Sequence:
            recording
    
    Raw Classes:
        KeyPress, KeySequence
    
    Extension modules:
        menus, glitches
        
    Chain KeyPresses and KeySequences using '+' and '*'. 
    Combine KeyPresses using '&'.
    
    eg: running_jump = (run & b) * 30 + run + (run & b) * 2
    
    When a KeyPress or KeySequence has been built up use .execute() to run it.
    
    Use help(nameofthing) to see the documentation and functions for that object. 
    (This will also give internal information)
    
    Please read the readme at 
    https://github.com/DavidCEllis/DarkSouls-TAS/tree/refactoring for examples.
